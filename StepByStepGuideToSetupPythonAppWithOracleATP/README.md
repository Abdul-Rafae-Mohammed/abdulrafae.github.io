# Workshop Overview

## Before You Begin
**What is an Application Express?**

Oracle Application Express (Oracle APEX), is the low code web application development tool for the Oracle Database. Application Express enables you to design, develop and deploy beautiful, responsive, database-driven applications, either on-premises or in the cloud. Using only a web browser and limited programming experience, you can rapidly develop and deploy professional applications that are both fast and secure for any device, from desktop to mobile. Oracle Application Express combines the qualities of a low code tool, productivity, ease of use, and flexibility with the qualities of an enterprise development tool, security, integrity, scalability, availability and built for the web.

**What is an Oracle REST Data Services(ORDS)?**

Oracle REST Data Services is a Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) based data service that provides enhanced security, file caching features, and RESTful Web Services. Oracle REST Data Services also increases flexibility through support for deployment in standalone mode, as well as using servers like Oracle WebLogic Server and Apache Tomcat.

**You are all set, let's begin!**
